_OMG! Another one who promises to lose weight in 2012, please kill me now!_ Worry not, it's quite the opposite :) Also, while it might be a bit suprising, there will be only one resolution. I will not promise anyone to lose weight. What's more, I will not promise to: exercise, drink less alcohol, sleep 8 hours a day, control my finances, go to specific place, or do whatever else.

There's only one promise I can make, and one I am able to keep: **I will maximize my happiness.** That's it. I will do this by eliminating negative energy from my life, and bringing in any positive influence I can possibly find. If staying healthy makes me happier, I'll go for it (sometimes it actually does). If going to Nepal is the thing, I'll surely be there. But I honestly have no idea right now. As a byproduct of this approach, I might be nicer to people around me. No guarantees, my motives are 100% selfish. On the 31st of December the only success metric will be: "Am I happier than I was a year ago?". Of course that's assuming there will be a chance do any summary. After all Maians could be right and 2012 will turn out to be the end of the world ... or I could simply die doing something stupid :)
