I just got the invoice for the domain, and decided that if I'm paying for it it might at least look half-decent. I no web designer, for me it's mostly difference between "it sucks" and "ok", with rare addition (<1%) of "awesome". This theme is "ok" and I doubt I'm going to heavily tweak it, if at all. I am also doing some experiments with Facebook integration - sharing links to post is the first to go, later hopefully commenting with Facebook account and some sort of "fanpage connect" so that anything appearing here gets automatically propagated to my FB profile.
