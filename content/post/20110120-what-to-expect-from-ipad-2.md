Before CES, I'd say "not much". The thing is, today Apple owns the tablet market (if defined as dedicated hardware running dedicated OS), there is almost no competition out there. But it is on the horizon. Take Motorola Xoom as an example. Hardware specs are way beyond iPad 1.0, and if Android 3.0 is going to be that good as people claim, Apple is going to be in real trouble if they release underpowered device. And there will be more and more Android tablets as we go deeper into 2011 ... My guesses for iPad 2 are: SD card slot, front facing camera, and 1GB of RAM. SD card slot is fairly cheap way to greatly improve the device, and is very much in line with intended use - something that would replace laptop for basic photo management tasks. Front facing camera - not much point to discuss. Memory is more interesting - a month ago I'd bet on 512 MB, exactly the same as in iPhone 4. But after CES it just sounds cheap and limited. Apple has tradition of selling as little as they can for as much as possible, but I don't really think they can get away with that. I think this is very moderate spec that should be considered basis for more. Retina display? Dual core CPU? Faster GPU? USB slot? They need another iPhone 4, and this time without the antennagate. Right now, after CES, anything is possible.
