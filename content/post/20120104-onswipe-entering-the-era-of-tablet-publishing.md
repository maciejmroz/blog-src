Classic web is dying, even if slowly. I will write longer post about that soon. In the meantime, try to use Flipboard for a while â€¦ and you will notice that classic portals/blogs are just dinosaurs. They might not know it yet but it doesn't change the facts.

If you are using WordPress, there is a cure called [Onswipe](http://www.onswipe.com). It's not perfect (in fact it is buggy as hell) but shows a lot of promise. Onswipe is a WordPress plugin that provides Flipboard-like experience on an IPad using HTML5. Enter this blog from an iPad, and you will enter completely different world. I suppose it should also work on Android tablets, after all it's just HTML. Onswipe is interesting for two resons. The first reason (and the reason for it's existence) is that it essentially changes website into an **application**. The second reason it is interesting is because these guys got [$5M in funding](http://venturebeat.com/2011/06/03/onswipe-funding/) to write a WordPress plugin :) Which leads to following conclusions: 

  * There might be another bubble forming, this time around anything with "mobile" in name
  * I live in a wrong country :)
